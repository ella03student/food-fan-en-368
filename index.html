  <p>
    Combining pasta, butter, and cheese is a practice that dates back to the 15th century. This dish as we know it today is credited to restaurant ownder Alfredo Di Lelio, who popularised it in the 20th century in Rome. He originally called it fettuccine al triplo burro, or "fettuccine with triple butter," and it quickly became a popular dish.
